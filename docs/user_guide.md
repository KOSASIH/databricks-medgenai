# MedGenAI: Generative AI for Personalized Medicine

Welcome to MedGenAI, a generative AI system for personalized medicine in the healthcare and life sciences industry. MedGenAI uses Databricks to manage and process large datasets, and integrates genomic and clinical data to generate personalized treatment recommendations for patients with rare diseases.

This user guide provides an overview of how to use MedGenAI, including how to process data, train the generative model, evaluate the model, and use the model for inference.

# Data Processing

The databricks/data_processing.ipynb notebook contains the code for processing the genomic and clinical data.

# Genomic Data

The genomic data should be in a CSV file with the following columns:

- chromosome: The chromosome on which the genetic variant is located.
- position: The position of the genetic variant on the chromosome.
- reference: The reference allele at the genetic variant position.
- alternate: The alternate allele at the genetic variant position.
- patient_id: A unique identifier for each patient.

The databricks/data_processing.ipynb notebook contains code for loading the genomic data from a CSV file, filtering the data based on quality metrics, and encoding the genomic data as input features for the generative model.

# Clinical Data

The clinical data should be in a CSV file with the following columns:

- patient_id: A unique identifier for each patient.
- diagnosis: A binary variable indicating whether the patient has the disease (1) or not (0).
- age: The age of the patient at the time of diagnosis.
- gender: The gender of the patient (M for male, F for female).
- treatment: The treatment received by the patient (Placebo, Drug A, Drug B, etc.).

The databricks/data_processing.ipynb notebook contains code for loading the clinical data from a CSV file, encoding the clinical data as input features for the generative model, and merging the genomic and clinical data.

# Model Evaluation

The databricks/model_evaluation.ipynb notebook contains the code for evaluating the generative model.

The databricks/model_evaluation.ipynb notebook contains code for evaluating the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The notebook also contains code for visualizing the model's performance using ROC curves and precision-recall curves.

# Inference

To use the trained model for inference on new genomic and clinical data, follow these steps:

1. Preprocess the data: Preprocess the new genomic and clinical data using the code in the databricks/data_processing.ipynb notebook.
2. Load the trained model: Load the trained model using the code in the databricks/model_training.ipynb notebook.
3. Make predictions: Use the trained model to make predictions on the new genomic and clinical data.

# Conclusion

MedGenAI is a powerful tool for personalized medicine in the healthcare and life sciences industry. By integrating genomic and clinical data, MedGenAI can generate personalized treatment recommendations for patients with rare diseases. With its user-friendly interface and powerful generative model, MedGenAI is a valuable resource for researchers and clinicians alike.
