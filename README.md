# databricks-medgenai

databricks-medgenai is a cutting-edge Generative AI software application for the healthcare and life sciences industry. The application uses Databricks to manage and process large genomic and clinical datasets, and integrates them with drug databases to generate potential personalized medical treatments for patients with rare diseases. The application uses state-of-the-art generative models to predict treatment options, and includes tools for model training, evaluation, and deployment. The databricks-medgenai repository includes code, documentation, and examples to help users get started with the application.

# MedGenAI: Generative AI for Personalized Medicine

MedGenAI is a high-tech system for personalized medicine in the healthcare and life sciences industry. The system uses Databricks to manage and process large datasets, and integrates genomic and clinical data to generate personalized treatment recommendations for patients with rare diseases.

The system includes a generative AI model that can predict the probability of a patient having a particular disease based on their genomic and clinical data. The model is trained and evaluated using the scripts in the scripts directory, and the trained model can be used for inference on new data using the models directory.

The system also includes utility scripts for data processing and preprocessing in the scripts directory, as well as unit and integration tests in the tests directory.
