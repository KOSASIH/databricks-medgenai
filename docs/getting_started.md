# MedGenAI: Generative AI for Personalized Medicine

Welcome to MedGenAI, a generative AI system for personalized medicine in the healthcare and life sciences industry. MedGenAI uses Databricks to manage and process large datasets, and integrates genomic and clinical data to generate personalized treatment recommendations for patients with rare diseases.

# Getting Started

To get started with MedGenAI, follow these steps:

1. Install Databricks: If you haven't already, sign up for a Databricks account and install the Databricks CLI on your local machine.
2. Clone the MedGenAI repository: Clone the MedGenAI repository from GitHub to your local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/KOSASIH/databricks-medgenai.git
```
3. Create a Databricks workspace: Create a new Databricks workspace and configure it to use the Databricks CLI.
4. Create a Databricks cluster: Create a new Databricks cluster with the required specifications for running MedGenAI.
5. Configure the Databricks cluster: Configure the Databricks cluster to use the necessary libraries and packages for running MedGenAI.
6. Upload data to Databricks: Upload the genomic and clinical data to Databricks using the Databricks CLI.
7. Run the Databricks notebooks: Run the Databricks notebooks for data processing, model training, and model evaluation.
8. Use the trained model for inference: Use the trained model for inference on new genomic and clinical data.
